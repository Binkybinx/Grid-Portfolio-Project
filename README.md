# Grid-Portfolio-Project

In this project, I focused on creating a responsive website using **CSS Grid** to efficiently layout the content. Through this process, I learned how to structure a webpage using grid properties such as `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, and `grid-gap`, allowing for precise control over the arrangement of elements. The grid layout helped me design a multi-column and flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

Additionally, I explored **CSS keyframe animations** to add interactive transitions and dynamic visual effects. Using `@keyframes`, I was able to control animations with properties like `animation-duration` and `animation-iteration-count`, giving the website a more engaging user experience.
